# Work In Progress

This is a guide to help you choose the best cost effective hardware for your machine learning projects.
Which one is best depends on your specific project needs and this can vary greatly but if you are currently unsure of what ML problems you want to solve but want to get a catch most scenarios, cost-efective rig now here is some suggestion (explaination below)

*   RTX 2060 Super 8g
*   Intel Xeon E5 2678v3 12c/24t
*   32G of DDR3 RAM 1866Mhz 
    (the 2678 supports both ddr3 and ddr4)
*   Huananzhi x99-tf motherboard
*   650w PSU


Steps:
Determine what ML problem you want to solve
Test it on the cloud first 
profile and indentify the bottlenecks
Get the hardware the addresses those bottlenecks

Scenarios:
AI playing games
AI playing games (only Atari)
RL for Robotics
NLP
AlphaZero
Vision tasks
