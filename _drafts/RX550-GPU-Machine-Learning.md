# Can the ultra budget RX550 be used for machine learning?
Inspiration behind this post [RX470 + ROCM](https://qiita.com/syoyo/items/c6bc6dd4efbc10049640) (It's in Japanese but there is many screenshots)
The author reports **~7600 examples/sec** with cifar10 on a **RX470 8GB** mining card. This is on par with a GTX 1060 at half the price on the second hand market AND with 2 GB more. Lots of Neural Nets require 8GB or more for training.
