Nothing to do with Machine Learning or Videogame dev (well yet) but if you are a fan of Magic: The Gathering like me you
probably know Kaldheim got released a few days ago. I like this set particulary because of the snow theme probably because I started playing Magic in 1995 when Ice Age was the lastest set and introduced the snow type for the first time in Magic's history.

In Pauper format the games are longer and you usually get more lands so paying only two snow mana for the troll's insane hability is a bargain, and can be used at will. Moreover it's easier to pay then regular colored mana if you are playing with more than one color. Notice that the tap effect is not a requirement, that means you can activate this hability even after attacking or tapping it for other reasons.

A powerful removal... in blue! Moreover what I like is that it double as backup creature, a 1/1 flyer can be handy!

If you want to draw the true power of snow, you need to play in multicolor

Mana acceleration in blue and on a 1/3 wizard on top of it

Haven't tried the boast hability yet, but you can manage to mince your deck by removing a couple of basic lands with this card, it should be quite useful, although the two mana cost for that hability is a bit steep
