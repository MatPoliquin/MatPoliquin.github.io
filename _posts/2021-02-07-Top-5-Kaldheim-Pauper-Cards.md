Nothing to do with Machine Learning or Videogame dev (well yet) but if you are a fan of Magic: The Gathering like me you
probably know Kaldheim got released a few days ago. I like this set particulary because of the snow theme probably because I started playing Magic in 1995 when Ice Age was the lastest set and introduced the snow type for the first time in magic's history
