I needed to replace the SSD in my laptop since I was running out of space.
I decided to give a try to the cheapest 1 Terabyte NVMe SSD I could find on taobao since I was curious to know if there was really a difference for everyday tasks as well as game dev related usage compared to more expensive ones such as the intel 760p ssd which I have for my desktop.


### Conclusion for those in a hurry
So far it performs quite well and without any percitible or meaningful differences for everyday tasks, game dev/coding related tasks and even with having a Ubuntu VM running in the background on Hyper-V. Althought for 4K video editing tasks or heavy server usage (which I did not tested) I would guess it's better to consider a better performing one.
